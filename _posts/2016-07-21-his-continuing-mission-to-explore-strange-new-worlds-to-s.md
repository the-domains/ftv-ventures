  His “continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life,
  new civilizations… to boldly go where no one has gone before.”Star Trek: The
  Next Generationpainted a utopian picture of a peaceful human race living in a
  future of unlimited material resources. The men and women of the starship
  Enterprise, freed from the constraints of compulsory work to live, dedicated
  their lives to the pursuit of knowledge, to exploration, and to creation. This
  was the technology of the originalStar Trek, but in world without war. For a
  certain kind of young person, with telescope in tiny hand and big eyes on
  worlds that waited for their visiting, the captain’s words became a moral
  compass in a world where the material impact of Gene Roddenberry was
  increasingly without question.

The tricorder, touch screens, natural language programming, the holodeck, replication via 3D printing, and the perennial "we've almost solved it!" in a reactionless thrust --- or, 'warp drive' --- all appeared on the Enterprise, under Kirk or Picard, decades before their manifestation in our physical reality. Simon Lake, one of the greatest inventors in history, said of_Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea_, "Jules Verne was in a sense the director-general of my life," and this year at Oculus' Connect Developer Conference every attendee was given a signed copy of_Ready Player One_. When a journalist asked an executive about the gift, he was told it was required reading at the company, and the story wasn't just inspiration for what they might be doing, it was in many ways directly informing the development of the product. Because the stories we consume shape the world.

But by the early 1990s, Picard's was not the only voice guiding young America's self-conception. After Hiroshima and Nagasaki, dystopian fears about the future no longer centered primarily on acts of God --- natural disasters, or, among the more religiously inclined, some literal, supernatural obliteration. For the first time in history, people were themselves capable of ending the entire world.
